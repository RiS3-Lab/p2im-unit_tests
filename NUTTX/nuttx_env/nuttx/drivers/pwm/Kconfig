config PWM_PULSECOUNT
	bool "PWM Pulse Count Support"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_PWM_PULSECOUNT
	---help---
		Some hardware will support generation of a fixed number of pulses.
		This might be used, for example to support a stepper motor.  If the
		hardware will support a fixed pulse count, then this configuration
		should be set to enable the capability.

config PWM_MULTICHAN
	bool "PWM Multiple Output Channel Support"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_PWM_MULTICHAN
	depends on !PWM_PULSECOUNT
	---help---
		Enables support for multiple output channels per timer.

if PWM_MULTICHAN

config PWM_NCHANNELS
	int "Number of Output Channels Per Timer"
	default 1
	range 1 6
	---help---
		Specifies the number of output channels per timer.  Each timer
		may support fewer output channels than this value.
