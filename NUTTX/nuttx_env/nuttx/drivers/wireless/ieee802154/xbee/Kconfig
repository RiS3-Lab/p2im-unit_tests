	---help---
		Work queue support is required to use the XBee MAC network
		driver.

		WARNING!! The IEEE802.15.4 network device must never run on the same
		work queue as does the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC.  That configuration will
		cause deadlocks:  The network logic may be blocked on the work queue
		waiting on resources that can only be freed by the MAC logic but the
		MAC is unable to run because the work queue is blocked.  The
		recommended configuration is:  Network on the LP work queue; MAC on HP
		work queue.  Blocking on the HP work queue is a very bad thing in
		any case.

config XBEE_NETDEV_RECVRPRIO
	int "Priority of frame receiver registerd with the MAC layer"
	default 1
	---help---
		When the MAC layer receives an incoming data frame, it passes the frame
		to registered receivers, in order of receiver priority, until one of the
		receivers claim the frame.

		An example case would be when 6LoWPAN and the MAC character driver are
		enabled. Both have receivers registered with the MAC. The 6LoWPAN layer
		should get assigned a higher priority than the character driver. In this
		case, the 6LoWPAN receiver will receive the frame first. If the frame is
		a 6LoWPAN frame, it will claim the frame and the MAC will not pass the
		frame to any additional receivers. If it does not claim the frame, the
		MAC layer will call the next highest priority receiver, in this case,
		the MAC character driver (which should always be lowest priority since
		it is a "catch-all" type receiver).
