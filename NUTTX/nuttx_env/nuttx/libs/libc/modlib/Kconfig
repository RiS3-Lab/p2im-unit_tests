menu "Module library configuration"
	depends on LIBC_MODLIB

config MODLIB_MAXDEPEND
	int "Max dependencies"
	default 2
	---help---
		This setting controls the number of other modules that a new module
		may depend on.  That is, when a new module in inserted via 'insmod'
		it may depend on symbols exported by other, already installed
		modules.  This is the maximum number of modules that export symbols
		to the new module.  This maximum is artificial; it is used in the
		current design because it uses some very simple, pre-allocated data
		structures.

		All dependencies logic my be eliminated by sett CONFIG_MODLIB_MAXDEPEND
		to zero.

config MODLIB_ALIGN_LOG2
	int "Log2 Section Alignment"
	default 2
	---help---
		Align all sections to this Log2 value:  0->1, 1->2, 2->4, etc.

config MODLIB_BUFFERSIZE
	int "Module I/O Buffer Size"
	default 128
	---help---
		This is an I/O buffer that is used to access the module file.
		Variable length items will need to be read (such as symbol names).
		This is really just this initial size of the buffer; it will be
		reallocated as necessary to hold large symbol names).  Default: 128

config MODLIB_BUFFERINCR
	int "Module I/O Buffer Realloc Increment"
	default 32
	---help---
		This is an I/O buffer that is used to access the module file.
		Variable length items will need to be read (such as symbol names).
		This value specifies the size increment to use each time the
		buffer is reallocated.  Default: 32

config MODLIB_DUMPBUFFER
	bool "Dump module buffers"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_INFO
	---help---
		Dump various module buffers for debug purposes
